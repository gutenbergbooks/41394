<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The idea of a bulletin on Michigan trees was first suggested
by Prof. Volney M. Spalding. It was thought that a bulletin
devoted entirely to the study of certain phases of tree life in
Michigan would stimulate interest in the study of our trees,
and influence many more people to associate themselves with the
growing number of tree lovers and with the supporters of the
movement for better forest conditions in the state.</p>

<p>The bulletin has been under consideration for a number of
years and much of the material given herein has been used in
the classes in forest botany at the University of Michigan. It
remained, however, for the present Curator of the Botanical
Garden and Arboretum to get the material into shape for publication,
and the present bulletin is the result of his industry and
perseverance. The preparation of the drawings and manuscript
has been made by him in connection with his work in the Garden.</p>

<p>The distinctive feature of the bulletin lies in its keys. The
keys commonly published are based upon characters which are
present but a short time during the year, or which can be used
only by an advanced student of botany. This bulletin presents
two keys. One is based upon characters which are present all
summer; the other uses the winter characters as a basis for
identification. By the use of the keys any person should be able
to name and learn the characteristics of the trees of Michigan
at any time of the year. These keys should prove of special
value to our students in the public schools, to members of nature
study clubs, and to the students in the forestry schools of the
state.</p>

<p>The order of arrangement and the nomenclature are essentially
those of &#8220;Gray&#8217;s New Manual of Botany.&#8221; Following a
tendency which is steadily gaining favor, all species names are
printed with a small letter, regardless of their origin. For the
convenience of the general reader, other scientific names which
are found in botanical manuals <i>in common use</i> are printed in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
parenthesis. In the case of exotics which are not included in the
Manual, other authorities have been followed. Sudworth&#8217;s
&#8220;Check List of the Forest Trees of the United States&#8221; (U. S.
Dept. Agr., Div. Forestry, Bul. 17) is in most cases authority
for the common names. They are names appearing in common
use today in some part of the state. The first name given is that
recommended by Sudworth for general use.</p>

<p>The drawings have been made from living or herbarium
material and are original. They are accurately drawn to a
scale, which is given in each case. In their preparation the
author has endeavored to call attention to the salient characters.
In the drawings of buds and twigs certain points, bundle-scars,
etc., have been emphasized more than is natural. In the descriptions
the attempt has been made to bring out those points of
similarity and contrast which are most useful for identification.</p>

<p>As the bulletin is not written especially for technical students
of botany, the author thought best to use as few technical terms
as possible in the descriptions. In some cases it was impossible
to avoid such terms, but with the help of the glossary the meaning
can be easily understood. Any person desiring to get a
more complete knowledge of trees should consult one of the larger
manuals. The arrangement used for the illustration and discussion
of each single tree makes it possible for the student to
compare the drawings with the description without turning a
page.</p>

<p>It is believed that with the aid of the drawings and descriptions
given in this bulletin any person will be able to name the
trees which grow in his yard, park, or woodlot. If, however,
any difficulty is found in naming the trees, the Curator will be
glad to name any specimens which may be mailed to him. He
would be glad to get in touch with persons interested in Michigan
trees and to receive any additional information relating to
the subject. Data concerning the distribution of the trees in the
state, and the addition of other Michigan trees to the present list
would be of especial value.</p>

<h2>HOW TO STUDY THE TREES</h2>

<p>People are everywhere associated with trees. Trees give
cooling shade in our parks and dooryards and along our highways;
they lend their beauty to the landscape and relieve it of
monotony; they yield many kinds of fruits, some of which
furnish man and the animals of the forest with food; and they
furnish vast quantities of lumber for a multitude of uses. How
important it is, then, that every person, whether school-child or
grown-up, should become acquainted with our trees. Most
people know a few of our commonest trees, but are ignorant of
the great wealth of tree forms about them. Some who may have
wished to go further have been hindered for lack of a teacher or
dismayed by the very multitude of manuals to which they have
had access.</p>

<p>In beginning a study of the trees the student should start on
a solid foundation, eliminating the uncertainties and the errors
which no doubt have appeared and retaining only the established
facts. Once started he should go slowly, assimilating each new
discovery before seeking another. He should begin with the
trees nearest home, and, as he gradually grows to know these
in all their aspects, should extend his trips afield. Not only should
he be able to name the trees when they are fully clothed in their
summer dress, but he should as readily know these same trees
when the leaves have fallen and only the bare branches stand
silhouetted against the sky. Then, and only then, will he derive
the utmost satisfaction from his efforts.</p>

<p>The characters which are used in studying the trees are
habit, leaves, flowers, fruit, buds, bark, distribution and habitat.
These will be discussed briefly in the next few pages, the same
order that is used in the detailed descriptions of species being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
maintained in the present discussion. A few drawings will also
be added to make clear certain points and to show comparative
forms.</p>

<p>NAME.&#8212;Every tree has one or several common names and
a scientific or Latin name. Some of these common names are
merely local, others have a more extended use. Some few
names apply to totally different species. Thus, Cottonwood in
Michigan is <i>Populus deltoides</i>, in Idaho and Colorado <i>Populus
angustifolia</i>, in California <i>Populus fremontii</i> and in Kentucky
<i>Tilia heterophylla</i>. While it should not be forgotten that in common
speech it is proper as well as convenient to call trees by their
common names, yet, in view of the many uncertainties pertaining
to their use, a scientific name is at times absolutely essential to
the clear understanding of what is meant. Latin is the language
in universal use by all scientists. No longer used by any civilized
nation, it has become a dead language and consequently never
changes. Its vocabulary and its constructions will a thousand
years hence be the same as they are today. Being in universal
use among scientists of all nationalities no confusion arises from
the use of a Latin word. The Oak in Germany is known as
<i>Eiche</i>, in France as <i>ch&ecirc;ne</i> and in Spain as <i>roble</i>, but the Latin
word <i>Quercus</i> is the same for all these countries.</p>

<p>A scientific name as applied to trees consists of at least two
parts, as <i>Quercus alba</i>; the first named is the genus and is always
written with a capital letter, the second is the species and is written
with a small letter, the two names constituting the briefest
possible description of the particular tree. It is customary to
add to these the name or an abbreviation of the name of the
person who first gave the name to the tree, as <i>Quercus alba L.</i>,
the abbreviation standing for Linnaeus. Sometimes a third name
is used, as <i>Acer saccharum nigrum</i>, referring in this case to a
variety of the ordinary Sugar Maple.</p>

<p>Genera which bear a relationship to each other are placed in
the same family, the family name always having the characteristic
ending&#8212;<i>aceae</i>. Related families are again grouped into
orders, with the characteristic ending&#8212;<i>ales</i>. Orders are in
like manner arranged into larger groups, called classes, and the
latter into still larger groups, divisions, etc., each with its characteristic
ending. Thus, <i>Acer saccharum nigrum</i> (<i>Michx. f.</i>)
<i>Britt</i>. is classified as follows:</p>

</p>

<p>HABIT.&#8212;Habit, or the general appearance of a plant, is
an important character of identification, especially as we become
more and more familiar with the trees. Two main types are
recognized, based on the manner of branching of the trunk, the
upright and the spreading. In the one the trunk extends straight
upwards without dividing, as is typical in most of the conifers,
and in the other the trunk divides to form several large branches
and the broad, spreading crown of most of our broad-leaf trees.
The crown in either case may be regular in outline or very
irregular, straggling or straight-limbed. Moreover, the tree
growing in the open, where there is no crowding and there is
plenty of light, may differ very greatly from the tree in the
forest, where the struggle for existence becomes very keen. A
short, thick trunk and low, spreading, many-branched crown
characterizes the tree in the open, whereas the forest tree has a
long, slender, clean trunk and a narrow crown of few branches.
In the descriptions of trees in this bulletin, unless otherwise
stated, the habit in the open is the one given. Again, the tree
may have been injured by storm or insect at some period of its
growth and its natural symmetry destroyed. Moreover, the age
of a tree has a great influence on its outline, young trees being
generally narrow and more or less conical, broadening out as
they become older. We may say, then, that each tree has an individuality
of its own, little eccentricities similar to those that make
people different from one another. And just as we have little
difficulty in recognizing our friends at a distance by some peculiarity
of walk or action, so are we able to recognize a great many
trees at a distance by some peculiarity of form or habit.</p>

<p>LEAVES.&#8212;With the advent of spring the buds of our broad-leaf
trees swell and burst and the leaves come forth and clothe
the trees with mantles of green, hiding the branches which have
been bare through the cold winter months. The evergreens, too,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
take on new color and begin a new period of growth. It is the
leaves which the beginner finds most interesting and in which
he finds a ready means of identification. It must be remembered,
however, that leaves vary greatly in size and shape and general
appearance. How large are the leaves on a flourishing sprout
and how small on a stunted tree of the same species growing
near by, but under adverse circumstances. How different are the
leaves of the big white oak standing in the yard; they are hardly
lobed on the lowermost branches, while higher up they are deeply
cut. Yet, in spite of the many modifications that leaves undergo,
the leaves of any one species have certain rather constant characters
which are found in all forms, and the student will have
little difficulty in selecting and recognizing typical leaves.</p>

<p>Leaves are either persistent, as in most of our conifers,
which stay green all winter, or they turn various colors with the
frost and fall early in autumn; often they hang dead and lifeless
far into the winter. The points about leaves which we are
accustomed to consider are the position or arrangement of the
leaves on the branch, whether simple or compound, size, shape,
texture, color, amount and character of pubescence, character of
the margin, venation, etc. The following diagrams will serve to
illustrate some of the ordinary forms and shapes of leaves, their
margins, etc.</p>

<p>FLOWERS.&#8212;Every tree when old enough bears flowers in
its proper season. Some of these, as the Catalpas, Locusts and
Horse-chestnuts are
very showy, others,
like the Oaks and
Hickories, are comparatively
inconspicuous;
some are brilliantly
colored, others are of
the same color as the
leaves. Nevertheless,
the flowers are very accurate
means of classification,
and their
only drawback is that
they last for such a
short period of time
each year.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as we have male and female in the animal world, so we
have male and female in the plant world. A few of our trees,
as the Locust, Basswood and Cherries have perfect flowers, bearing
both stamens and pistil. The great majority, however, have
unisexual flowers, bearing stamens or pistils, but not both. When
both male and female flowers are found on the same tree, the
flowers are said to be monoecious, and when male flowers occur
on one tree and the female on a different tree, the flowers are
said to be dioecious. The Cottonwood is dioecious, and the
little seeds are surrounded by a tuft of long, white hairs which
enables the wind to carry them to considerable distances from the
parent tree, to the disgust of people living within range. Many
cities forbid the planting of Cottonwood on account of the
&#8220;cotton.&#8221; Since in some cases it is desirable to plant this rapid-growing
tree, as in cities burning large amounts of soft coal, it
is a distinct advantage to know that male trees are lacking in the
objectionable &#8220;cotton&#8221; and may be planted safely.</p>

<p>Before trees can produce fruit their flowers must be fertilized,
i.e., pollen from the anther of a stamen must come in contact
with the stigma of a pistil. Some flowers are self-fertilized,
others are cross-fertilized. For a long time it was not known
how fertilization was accomplished, but now we know that many
insects, like the nectar-loving bees and butterflies, and in other
cases the wind transport the pollen from one flower to another,
often miles being traversed before the right kind of flower or a
flower in the right stage of development is found. And many
are the modifications of flowers to insure this transference of
pollen.</p>

<p>FRUIT.&#8212;So numerous and so varied are the forms of tree
fruits that it would only be confusing to enumerate their various
characters. Some fruits, as the achenes of the Poplars and Willows,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
are so small and light that they are carried long distances by
the wind; others, like the hickory nuts and walnuts, are too heavy
to be wind-blown. Many fruits are of considerable economic and
commercial importance and are gathered and marketed on a large
scale; such are the hickory nuts, walnuts,
chestnuts, etc. Some, not esteemed
by man, form an important article of
diet for the birds and small animals
of the forest. Unfortunately, there are
a number of limitations to the usefulness
of fruit for identification purposes.
Some trees require years to
mature their fruit. Many trees, while
producing an abundance of fruit at certain
intervals, bear none at all or only
very small and uncertain quantities between
the years of abundance. Again,
in the case of dioecious trees, only the
female or pistillate bear fruit. Notwithstanding
these limitations tree fruits
are a very valuable aid to the student,
and he should always search closely for
evidences of their presence and character.</p>

<p class="caption2 padl2">a. Tip-scar.<br />b. Lateral bud.<br />c. Leaf-scar.<br />d. Stipule-scars.</p></div>

<p>WINTER-BUDS.&#8212;Buds, with their
accompanying leaf-and stipule-scars
form the basis of tree identification in
winter. The size, color, position with
reference to the twig, number and arrangement
and character of bud-scales,
etc., are all characters of the greatest
value in winter determinations. Buds
are either terminal or lateral, depending
on their position on the twig. A lateral bud is one situated on
the side of a twig in the axil of a leaf-scar. A terminal bud is
one situated at the end of a twig, where it is ready to continue
the growth of the twig the following spring. In the keys an
important consideration is the presence or absence of the terminal
bud. Inasmuch as the determination of this point gives the
beginner some trouble at first, it is hoped that the accompanying
diagrams and explanatory remarks will make the distinction clear.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;"><a name="illus_017" id="illus_017"></a>

<p class="caption2 padl2">a. Terminal bud.<br />b. Lateral bud.<br />c. Leaf-scar.<br />d. Bundle-scars.<br />e. Pith.</p></div>

<p>In the Elms, Willows, Basswood and many other species the
terminal bud and a small portion of the tip of the twig dies
and drops off in late autumn, leaving a small scar at the end of
the twig (a, fig. VI). The presence of this tip-scar indicates that
the terminal bud is absent. Often a
lateral bud will be found very close to
the tip-scar (b, fig. VI), which, bending
into line with the twig, makes it appear
terminal. However, the presence of a
leaf-scar immediately below it shows it
to be a lateral bud (c, fig. VI). In some
large twigs the eye unaided will serve to
find the tip-scar, but with the smaller
twigs a hand-lens is necessary.</p>

<p>The arrangement, size and shape of
the leaf-scars (c, fig. VII) are important
factors in identification by winter characters.
Within the leaf-scars are one or
more dots (d, fig. VII), sometimes quite
inconspicuous, often very prominent.
These are the scars left by the fibro-vascular
bundles which run through the
petiole into the blade of the leaf, and
are designated as bundle-scars. There
may be only one as in Sassafras and
Hackberry, two as in Ginkgo, three as
in the Poplars and Cherries, or many;
and they may be arranged in a U- or
V-shaped line, or they may be without
definite order. Often stipule-scars
(d, fig. VI) occur on either side of the
leaf-scar; these are scars left by the
fall of a pair of small leaflets called stipules and located at the
base of the leaves, and their form varies according to the form
of the stipules which made them.</p>

<p>BARK.&#8212;The woodsman uses the bark of a tree more than
any other character in distinguishing the trees about him, and he
is often able to use this character alone with much accuracy at
great distances. However, the appearance of bark differs so
greatly with the age of the tree and with its environment that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
it is difficult to describe it accurately. Some characters are distinctive,
however, and serve as a ready means of identification;
such characters are the peeling of the Sycamore and Paper
Birch, the &#8220;shagging&#8221; of the Shagbark Hickory, the spicy taste
of Sassafras bark and the mucilaginous inner bark of the Slippery
Elm.</p>

<p>WOOD.&#8212;It is not expected that the information given under
this heading will be of any particular value in identifying living
trees. Often, however, the student finds himself in the midst of
felling operations, when the information concerning the wood is
of considerable value.</p>

<p>DISTRIBUTION AND HABITAT.&#8212;To a lesser extent do
distribution and habitat of a species aid in the identification of a
tree. It is a distinct aid to know that the Chestnut is native in
south-eastern Michigan only and that the Mountain Ash does not
extend south of Ludington. So too, knowing the water-loving
habit of the Swamp White Oak, we would not expect to find this
same tree flourishing on the top of a hard, dry hill.</p>

<p>The characters, then, which are used to identify the trees
about us are many. Not all will be available at any one time, not
all have been mentioned in the foregoing pages nor in the manual.
It is our opinion, however, that the student will not be greatly
handicapped by this lack of detail, but rather that he will take
great interest and genuine pleasure in discovering these things
for himself.</p>

<h2>ARTIFICIAL KEYS, HOW MADE AND USED</h2>

<p>An artificial key is a scheme for easily and quickly identifying
any unknown object under consideration. This bulletin being
devoted to the trees of Michigan, the keys to be found herein
are intended to make it possible for any person, even if his botanical
training be meager, to determine what trees grow about any
home or farm, city park or woodlot in the state. With certain
modifications and limitations they may prove useful in other
localities as well. Since many people are unfamiliar with the
construction and use of keys for identification, it will be the purpose
of the following paragraphs to briefly outline the principles
of construction and the manner of using the keys to be found
here.</p>

<p>The keys are based on the most striking similarities and
differences which the various parts of trees&#8212;twigs, buds, leaves,
etc.&#8212;show, i. e., those characters which stand out in bold relief,
which catch the eye at first sight. Two alternatives are presented,
either a character <i>is</i> or <i>is not</i> present; these are the only choices
possible. Indeed, further divisions are unnecessary and only lead
to confusion and possible oversight. The two diametrically
opposed characters are said to be co&ouml;rdinate in rank. In the
keys they are preceded by the same letter or letters (<i>a</i> and <i>aa</i> or
<i>b</i> and <i>bb,</i> etc.) and are set at the same distance from the left
margin of the page. Often <i>a</i> and <i>aa,</i> or <i>b</i> and <i>bb</i> are further
divisible into other groups; in every case the characters are
opposed (a positive and a negative) and are given co&ouml;rdinate
rank. It is desirable for mechanical reasons to divide the main
divisions of the key more or less evenly, but this is not always
feasible, nor should it be religiously adhered to.</p>

<p>Suppose as a concrete example that it is desired to construct
a key to distinguish five houses in a city block. Three of these
are of wood construction, two are of brick, and of the two
wooden houses one is painted white and one brown. We may
classify them as follows:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span></p>

<p>It is desirable in many cases to add other characters to
lessen the liability of confusion, where the characters chosen are
not distinct, and to show the user that he is on the right track.
Thus, in the example just given, green color and slate color under
certain defects of the eye, a coating of dust or deficiencies of the
light might be confused, under which circumstances we would be
justified in adding to the above statements without the criticism
of description being made. Thus:</p>

<table width="100%" summary="artificial keys" border="0">

<td class="right vertt">bb.</td>
<td class="left" colspan="3">&nbsp;</td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="right vertt">&nbsp;</td>
<td class="right vertt" colspan="2">c.</td>
<td class="left">Trimmings green color; gable roof.</td>
<td class="right"><i>Jones&#8217; house</i></td>

<td class="right vertt">&nbsp;</td>
<td class="right" colspan="2">cc.</td>
<td class="left">Trimmings slate color; mansard roof.</td>
<td class="right"><i>Brown&#8217;s house</i></td>
</tr></table>

<p>The keys in this bulletin are constructed on the above principles.
They are not in all cases as simple as the illustration just
used, but if the reader has mastered the house illustration he
will have little or no trouble with the larger keys. Suppose that
(during a summer stroll) you come across a large tree with
rough, hard bark and thin, lobed leaves which you do not know.
Turning to the <i>Summer Key to the Genera</i> you find first <i>a.
Leaves simple</i>, and contrasted with this <i>aa. Leaves compound.</i>
Obviously the leaf is simple and the genus sought lies in that
portion of the key preceding <i>aa</i>, i.e., under <i>a.</i> <i>b</i> and <i>bb</i> under <i>a</i>
give you a choice between <i>Leaves needle-shaped</i>, <i>awl-shaped</i>,
<i>strap-shaped</i> or <i>scale-like</i> and <i>Leaves broad and flat</i>. The leaf
being broad and flat you pass to <i>c</i> and <i>cc</i> under <i>bb</i>. Here you
have a choice between <i>Leaves alternate or clustered</i> and <i>Leaves
opposite or whorled</i>. Inspection shows the arrangement to be
opposite, and you know that the genus sought lies in that portion
of the key between <i>cc</i> and <i>aa</i>. Passing to <i>d</i> and <i>dd</i> under <i>cc</i>
gives the choice between <i>Margin of leaves entire or only slightly
undulate</i> and <i>Margin of leaves serrate to lobed</i>. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
leaf is deeply lobed. It is then either a <i>Viburnum</i> or an <i>Acer</i>,
and the fact that the leaf-margin is lobed and not finely serrate
brings the chase down to <i>Acer</i>. Before going further go back
over the key and make careful note of the particular characters
which were used to separate this genus from the other genera
and try to fix these in mind. This done, turn to the page indicated,
where you will find a <i>Summer Key to the Species of Acer</i>.
You run through this key in the same manner that you did the
genus key. If you have been careful in your search you will
finally stop at <i>Acer saccharum</i>. Once more pause and go back
over this key and try to fix in mind the characters which were
used to separate the various species, especially the difference
between your tree and <i>Acer platanoides</i>, which it so closely
resembles. This done, turn to the page indicated and compare
the characters of your tree with the drawings and descriptions.
If you are satisfied with your diagnosis, well and good. If you
find that you are wrong, go over the keys again and find wherein
you were led astray.</p>

<p>Before you leave the tree take a sample of leaf properly
labeled which you can press between the pages of an old magazine
and save for future reference. Do this with other trees which
you may find and when you get home lay them out side by side
so that the labels will not show and compare them. A few trials
of this kind will serve to form a mental picture of each leaf
which you will remember.</p>

<p>A very helpful practice for the beginner is that of making
keys based upon various characters. Practice keys of this kind
will bring out the differences and likenesses of trees as will no
other means, and characters which have hitherto escaped the eye
will be prominently brought forward. Nor should the student
take his characters from books, but rather should he go to the
woods and get his knowledge first hand.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to state that the key is a valuable
crutch while learning to walk, but once the leg is strong enough
to bear the weight it should be discarded, lest it become a burden.
A key has for its main object the guidance of the student through
the preliminary steps leading to a more intimate knowledge of the
trees. When once he knows a tree, instinctively, because of long
acquaintance with it, just as he knows people, then the need for
a key will have ceased.</p>

<h4><b>GINKGOACEAE</b></h4>

<h5><b>Ginkgo.<a name="FNanchor_C" id="FNanchor_C"></a><a href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> Maidenhair Tree</b></h5>

<h5><i>Ginkgo biloba L.</i> [<i>Salisburia adiantifolia Smith</i>]</h5>

<p>HABIT.&#8212;A slender tree in youth, with slender, upright
branches, becoming broader with age and forming a symmetrical,
pyramidal crown; probably 60-80 feet high, with a trunk diameter
of 2-4 feet.</p>

<p>LEAVES.&#8212;Clustered at the ends of short, spur-like shoots,
or scattered alternately on the long terminal branches; simple;
2-5 inches broad; more or less fan-shaped; usually bilobed
and irregularly crenate at the upper extremity; thin and leathery;
glabrous, pale yellow-green on both sides; petioles long,
slender; turning a clear, golden yellow before falling in autumn.</p>

<p>FLOWERS.&#8212;May, with the leaves; dioecious; the staminate
in short-stalked, pendulous catkins, 1 to 1-1/2 inches long, yellow; the
pistillate more or less erect on the shoot, long-stalked, consisting
of 2 naked ovules, one of which usually aborts.</p>

<p>FRUIT.&#8212;Autumn; a more or less globose drupe, orange-yellow
to green, about 1 inch in diameter, consisting of an acrid,
foul-smelling pulp inclosing a smooth, whitish, somewhat flattened,
almond-flavored nut.</p>

<p>WINTER-BUDS.&#8212;Terminal bud about 1/8 inch long, conical,
smooth, light chestnut-brown; lateral buds divergent, usually only
on rapid-growing shoots.</p>

<p>BARK.&#8212;Twigs gray-brown and smooth; thick, ash-gray and
somewhat roughened on the trunk, becoming more or less fissured
in old age.</p>

<p>WOOD.&#8212;Light, soft, weak, close-grained, yellow-white to
light red-brown, with thin, lighter colored sapwood.</p>

<p>NOTES.&#8212;Origin in dispute, but probably a native of northern
China. Extensively cultivated in China and Japan, where its
fruit is esteemed. Easily propagated from seed. Thrives in
deep, well-drained, rich soil. Practically free from insect and
fungous attacks, and little harmed by the smoke of cities. Probably
hardy throughout the southern half of the Lower Peninsula.</p>

<h4><b>WINTER KEY TO THE SPECIES OF SALIX</b></h4>

<p class="small">The classification of the Willows is a task for the specialist,
even when leaves and both staminate and pistillate flowers are
obtainable. It is impractible for the novice to attempt the determination
of species of Salix with winter characters alone. Consequently
the usual winter key is omitted.</p>

<h4><b>SALICACEAE</b></h4>

<h5><b>Willow</b></h5>

<h5><i>Salix (Tourn.) L.</i></h5>

<p>The genus <i>Salix</i> is represented in Michigan by thirty or more
distinct species, and there are many more hybrids. The majority
of these are shrubs, only a few becoming truly arborescent.
Because of the similarity of their botanical characters, the frequency
with which they hybridize, and the facility with which
they respond to their environment only an expert is competent
to identify the species so abundant along our water courses and
on the banks of our lakes and swamps. The scope of this work
being necessarily limited, it has been deemed best to describe
but two of our native willows and two of our foreign neighbors
which are frequently planted.</p>

<h5><b>Lombardy Poplar</b></h5>

<h5><i>Populus nigra italica DuRoi</i> [<i>Populus fastigiata Desf.</i>]
[<i>Populus dilatata Ait.</i>]</h5>

<p>HABIT.&#8212;A tree 75-100 feet high, with a short, ridged and
buttressed trunk 4-6 feet in diameter and a narrow, spire-like
crown of erect branches.</p>

<p>LEAVES.&#8212;Alternate, simple, 2-4 inches long, and usually
somewhat broader than long; broad-deltoid, abruptly acuminate;
finely but bluntly crenate-serrate; thick and firm; dark green and
shining above, lighter and more or less lustrous beneath; petioles
slender, laterally compressed, 1-2 inches long.</p>

<p>FLOWERS.&#8212;April-May, before the leaves; dioecious; the
staminate in sessile, dark red, cylindrical catkins about 3 inches
long; the pistillate not present in the United States; calyx 0;
corolla 0; stamens about 8, with white filaments and purple
anthers.</p>

<p>FRUIT.&#8212;Not formed in the United States in the absence of
pistillate flowers.</p>

<p>WINTER-BUDS.&#8212;Terminal bud conical, slightly angled,
taper-pointed, glutinous, about 3/8 inch long; lateral buds smaller,
appressed.</p>

<p>BARK.&#8212;Twigs glabrous, shining yellow, becoming gray;
thick and gray-brown on old trunks, deeply and irregularly furrowed.</p>

<p>WOOD.&#8212;Light, soft, easily worked, not liable to splinter,
weak, not durable, light red-brown, with thick, nearly white sapwood.</p>

<p>NOTES.&#8212;Thought to be a native of Afghanistan. Very
rapid in growth. Short-lived. Spreads by means of suckers and
fallen branches. Useful for ornamental purposes. Because of
crowding the limbs die early, which remain and cause the tree to
look unsightly.</p>

<h4><b>ROSACEAE</b></h4>

<h5><b>The Haws, Thorns, Hawthorns or Thorn-apples</b></h5>

<h5><i>Crataegus L.</i></h5>

<p>Owing to the complexity of the various forms in this group,
the present state of uncertainty as to the value of certain characters,
and the questionable validity of many of the assigned
names, it is thought to be beyond the scope of this bulletin to give
more than a general description of the group as a whole, recommending
the more ambitious student to the various manuals and
botanical journals and papers for more detailed information.</p>

<p>The <i>Crataegi</i> are generally low, wide-spreading trees or
shrubs, with strong, tortuous branches and more or less zigzag
branchlets usually armed with stiff, sharp thorns. The bark
varies from dark red to gray and is shallowly fissured or scaly.
The leaves are alternate, simple, generally serrate, often lobed,
with short or long petioles. The flowers appear in May or June,
with or after the leaves, in simple or compound corymbs, whitish
or pinkish, perfect. The fruit is a red to yellow, sometimes blue
or black pome, subglobose to pear-shaped, with usually dry and
mealy flesh and 1-5 seeds. The winter-buds are small, nearly
globose, lustrous brown. <i>Crataegus</i> produces wood which is
heavy, hard, tough, close-grained, red-brown, with thick, pale
sapwood. The Haws are trees of the pasture-lands, the roadside,
the open woods and the stream-banks, and are more common
in the southern than in the northern portions of the state.
Some of the species are desirable as ornaments in parks and
gardens on account of their beautiful and abundant flowers and
showy fruits.</p>

<h5><b>Honey Locust. Three-thorned Acacia</b></h5>

<h5><i>Gleditsia triacanthos L.</i></h5>

<p>HABIT.&#8212;A tree usually 50-75 feet high, with a trunk diameter
of 2-3 feet; dividing near the ground into several large,
upright branches which divide again into long, slender, horizontal
branchlets; both trunk and large branches armed with stout,
rigid, simple or branched spines.</p>

<p>LEAVES.&#8212;Alternate, pinnately or bipinnately compound,
7-12 inches long. Leaflets 18 or more, 3/4-1-1/2 inches long, one-third
as broad; lanceolate-oblong; remotely crenulate-serrate;
thin; lustrous, dark green above, dull yellow-green beneath.
Petioles and rachises pubescent.</p>

<p>FLOWERS.&#8212;May-June, when the leaves are nearly full
grown; polygamo-dioecious; the staminate in short, many-flowered,
pubescent racemes; the pistillate in slender, few-flowered
racemes; on shoots of the preceding season; calyx
campanulate, hairy 3-5-lobed; petals 3-5, greenish; stamens 3-10;
ovary 1-celled, woolly.</p>

<p>FRUIT.&#8212;Autumn, falling in early winter; flat, pendent,
twisted, brown legumes, 12-18 inches long, short-stalked in short
racemes; seeds 12-14, oval, flattened.</p>

<p>WINTER-BUDS.&#8212;Terminal bud absent; lateral buds minute,
3 or more superposed, glabrous, brownish.</p>

<p>BARK.&#8212;Twigs lustrous, red-brown, becoming gray-brown;
thick on the trunk, iron-gray to blackish and deeply fissured into
long, narrow ridges roughened by small scales.</p>

<p>WOOD.&#8212;Hard, strong, coarse-grained, durable in contact
with the ground, red-brown, with thin, pale sapwood.</p>

<p>DISTRIBUTION.&#8212;Indigenous to the extreme southern portion
of the state, but is planted as far north as Bay City.</p>

<p>HABITAT.&#8212;Prefers deep, rich loam, but grows on a
variety of soils.</p>

<p>NOTES.&#8212;Grows rapidly and is long-lived and free from
disease. Easily transplanted. The leaves appear late in spring
and fall early in autumn. The stiff spines and long pods which
litter the ground make the tree unsuitable for street or ornamental
use.</p>

<h4><b>SIMARUBACEAE</b></h4>

<h5><b>Ailanthus. Tree of Heaven</b></h5>

<h5><i>Ailanthus glandulosa Desf.</i></h5>

<p>HABIT.&#8212;A handsome, rapid-growing, short-lived tree, attaining
a height of 50-70 feet and a trunk diameter of 2-4 feet,
with a spreading, rather loose and open crown and a coarse, blunt
spray.</p>

<p>LEAVES.&#8212;Alternate, pinnately compound, 1-3 feet long.
Leaflets 11-41 in number, 2-6 inches long and about one-third as
broad; ovate-lanceolate; entire with the exception of two or
more coarse, glandular teeth at the base; glabrous, dark green
above, paler beneath, turning a clear yellow in autumn or falling
without change; ill-scented. Petioles smooth, terete, swollen at
the base.</p>

<p>FLOWERS.&#8212;June, when the leaves are full grown; polygamo-dioecious;
small, yellow-green, borne in upright panicles
6-12 inches or more in length; calyx 5-lobed; petals 5, greenish,
hairy; stamens 10. Staminate flowers ill-scented, pistillate almost
free from odor.</p>

<p>FRUIT.&#8212;October; 1-celled, 1-seeded samaras, spirally
twisted, reddish or yellow-green, borne in crowded clusters.</p>

<p>WINTER-BUDS.&#8212;Terminal bud absent; lateral buds about
1/8 inch long, subglobose, brownish, downy.</p>

<p>BARK.&#8212;Twigs yellowish to red-brown, velvety-downy;
thin, grayish and shallowly fissured on old trunks.</p>

<p>WOOD.&#8212;Soft, weak, of coarse and open grain, pale yellow,
satiny, with thick, lighter colored sapwood.</p>

<p>NOTES.&#8212;A native of China, but naturalized in the United
States and planted frequently in southern Michigan as a foliage
tree. Only the pistillate trees should be planted, as these are
almost free from the objectionable odor of the staminate trees.
The smoke and dust of our large cities have little effect on the
foliage, and the trees are perfectly hardy in the southern part
of the state.</p>

feet, with a trunk diameter of 2-3 feet; branches stout, forming
a broad, rounded, symmetrical crown.</p>

<p>LEAVES.&#8212;Opposite, simple, concave, 5-7 inches across, the
breadth usually exceeding the length; usually 5-lobed at maturity,
the two lower lobes being small, often reduced to a mere curve
in the outline, the pointed lobes undulate or entire and narrowed
from the broad, shallow sinuses; thick and firm; glabrous above,
downy beneath; petioles stout, usually pendent, tomentose. The
sides of the larger leaves often droop giving to the tree an air
of depression.</p>

<p>FLOWERS.&#8212;May, with the leaves; monoecious; in nearly
sessile, umbel-like corymbs; about 1/4 inch long, yellow, on
slender, hairy pedicels 2-3 inches long; calyx campanulate, pilose,
5-lobed; corolla 0; stamens 7-8; ovary hairy.</p>

<p>FRUIT.&#8212;Ripens in autumn; glabrous, paired samaras, clustered
on drooping pedicels; wings set wide apart, but only
slightly diverging.</p>

<p>WINTER-BUDS.&#8212;Small, ovoid, acute, with dark red-brown,
acute scales, hoary-pubescent on the outer surface.</p>

<p>BARK.&#8212;Twigs smooth, pale gray; becoming thick, deeply

<h5><b>Green Ash</b></h5>

<h5><i>Fraxinus pennsylvanica lanceolata (Borkh.) Sarg.</i> [<i>Fraxinus
lanceolata Borkh.</i>] [<i>Fraxinus viridis Michx. f.</i>]</h5>

<p>Considered by some authors to be a distinct species, and by
others a variety of <i>F. pennsylvanica Marsh.</i>, which it resembles.
The main points of difference are:</p>

<p class="em3">
The usual absence of pubescence from the branchlets,
the underside of the leaflets, and the petioles.</p>

<p class="em3">
The rather narrower, shorter, and more sharply
serrate leaflets.</p>

<p class="em3">
The color of the leaves, which is bright green on both
sides.</p>

<p>A very hardy tree, of rapid growth and desirable habit, making
it useful for ornamental and street planting. Easily transplanted.</p>

<p>Of rare occurrence in Michigan, but has been reported from
several localities.</p>
